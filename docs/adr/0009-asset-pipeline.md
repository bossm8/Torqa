# ADR 0009 — 3D asset pipeline and asset licensing

- Status: accepted; the realism target and MPFB2 superseded by [ADR 0011](0011-stylized-look.md)
- Date: 2026-10-03

## Context

The 3D world should reach MyWhoosh-like realism for terrain and rider (R44–R46). That needs real
models (rider, bike, trees, rocks) and PBR textures. The project is GPL-3.0 with zero budget
(R2), so every asset must be free and redistributable in a public repository (R47). Realistic
humans are hard to model from scratch; mechanical parts like a bike are easy to describe in code.

## Decision

- **Scripted models.** Models are produced by **Blender Python scripts** run headless in the
  devcontainer (Blender and the MPFB2 add-on are container packages; see the amendments: Blender
  moved to its own container, MPFB2 was never added). The scripts are the source
  of truth; they export glTF (`.glb`) for Godot.
- **Both are committed**: the scripts and the exported `.glb` files, so the app builds without
  Blender and changes to models are reviewable. Each asset is documented (what it is, how to
  regenerate it, its sources and license).
- **Riders** (female, male) start from **MakeHuman** base meshes via **MPFB2** (CC0 output,
  rigged); kit materials and the cadence-driven pedaling animation (pedal IK) are scripted.
  *(Superseded: riders come from Blender Studio's CC0 Human Base Meshes, see the amendment of
  2026-10-06.)*
- **Bike**: a parametric model built by script, so other frames and wheels can follow (R46).
- **Vegetation, rocks**: generated (geometry nodes / Sapling) or taken from free asset libraries.
- **Textures**: CC0 PBR sets (Poly Haven, ambientCG). *(Superseded: no textures, flat palette
  colours, ADR 0011.)*
- **Allowed licenses**: own work, CC0, CC-BY, CC-BY-SA (one-way compatible with GPLv3). Every
  third-party asset is listed with author, source and license in a credits file.
- **Not allowed**: NC or ND licenses, engine-locked assets (Quixel Megascans / Fab — Unreal-only),
  Mixamo (raw files may not be redistributed).

## Consequences

- Anyone can regenerate or change the models with free tools; the repository stays fully open.
- The container image grows by Blender (~hundreds of MB).
- Art direction needs human review of rendered previews; scripts make iterations cheap.
- Committed `.glb` files grow the repository; large binaries may move to Git LFS if needed.

## Amendment — 2026-10-04: Blender in its own container; buildings first

- Blender publishes Linux builds for x86-64 only, while the devcontainer runs natively on
  Apple Silicon (arm64). Unofficial arm64 builds are not used. Instead Blender (official 5.2.2
  LTS, checksum-verified) lives in a separate **art container** (`art/Dockerfile`, run with
  `scripts/art.sh`) built for linux/amd64; on Apple Silicon Docker runs it emulated, which
  scripted modelling tolerates (a full build of the building models takes seconds). The
  devcontainer stays lean. MPFB2 is added when the rider work starts.
- The first models are **buildings** (`art/buildings`): houses, chalets, Bernese farmhouses,
  churches, chapels, sheds and garages in several sizes. The files carry shape, texture
  coordinates in metres and material **names** only; the app gives each name its look
  (`app/scenes/building_models.gd`), and varies plaster, roof and shutter colours per
  building. `models.json` beside the models lists their footprints and heights, which the
  world uses to fit them to map outlines.
- `scripts/render-models.sh` renders every model as the world draws it, for review.

## Amendment — 2026-10-06: what the stylized look kept

With the stylized look (ADR 0011) the pipeline stays — scripted Blender models in the art
container, `.glb` files committed, material names styled by the app — but:

- **MPFB2 was never added.** Its humans are realistic; the riders are derived by script from
  Blender Studio's **Human Base Meshes** (CC0), kept untouched under `art/sources/`.
- **No textures.** Every model carries material names only and gets flat palette colours
  (`app/assets/palette.json`); the CC0 texture sets were retired with their credits.
- **Model groups** are `art/buildings` (houses, chalets, farmhouses, churches, chapels, sheds,
  offices, hotels, public buildings; since #136 and #137 also castles, lighthouses and houses
  for the subtropics), `art/vegetation` (trees, bushes and rocks; palms and tropical plants
  since #136), `art/clouds` and `art/riders`, each with a `build.py` writing its models and
  manifest under `app/assets/models/`. `scripts/render-models.sh` and
  `scripts/render-riders.sh` render them all for review and, with `GALLERY` (2026-10-10), for
  the gallery in `art/README.md`.
