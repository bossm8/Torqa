# Ride HUD

The figures on the left of the ride screen are yours to choose, per rider. Edit them in
**Rider settings → HUD** (the **Profile** tab → the pencil), or with
**Settings → HUD** while riding (button or key S) — the ride keeps going, and changes are
saved to the rider.

The editor shows the **HUD** itself with example values, and the figures still **available**.

- **Drag a figure straight into the HUD** to where it should appear: a blue line shows where
  it will land — before or after the figure under the pointer (left/right in the grid,
  above/below the large figure). Dropping on free space adds it at the end; + does the same
  with a click.
- **Move** figures by dragging them within the HUD, and **drag them back** onto the available
  list to remove them.
- The **first** figure is shown large at the top; with power figures, your W/kg and power zone
  appear below it. Up to 13 figures in total.
