# Courses

A course is a prepared route saved as one `.tqc` file: the GPX track plus the terrain, map data
it needs. Courses ride **fully offline**, on any computer.

## Prepare a course

Import a GPX route with **Import** on the Courses tab while online. The track is put onto the
roads and paths it rides (from OpenStreetMap): GPS wander and corners cut between sparse points
disappear, so the road you ride is the real one. Where a service road, cycle path or side street
runs right beside the road, the route stays on the road unless the track clearly follows the
other. Stretches away from any mapped road keep their course.
Torqa asks for the course's **name** (suggested from the file), downloads terrain and map
data, builds the 3D world and adds the course to your library. If a course of that name exists
already, choose **Replace** to replace it or **Keep both**.

## Ride a course

Click its card on the Courses tab, then **Ride**. No internet connection is needed. **← Courses**
or a click on the Courses tab brings the gallery back.

## Share a course

Course files are ordinary files: send them by mail, put them on Nextcloud, a USB stick or a
website. To use a course someone sent you, open the `.tqc` file with **Import**;
it is copied into your library.

The library is the `courses` folder of the Torqa data directory:

| System | Folder |
|---|---|
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Torqa/courses` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Torqa\courses` |
| Linux | `~/.local/share/torqa/courses` |

A course's card shows its route on the map of its surroundings, drawn when the course was
prepared and kept in the course file; a course from an earlier Torqa gets its map the next time
it is opened. You can also copy `.tqc` files there directly. A name too long for its card shows
in full when you hover over it. The data directory may live in a synced folder.

## Video courses

Courses ridden along a video refer to the video rather than containing it. Torqa keeps a copy
of the video (a hard link on the same disk) next to the `.tqc` in the library when the course
is prepared; keep the two together when moving or sharing them ([video.md](video.md)).

## Size and attribution

A course takes a few MB; sizes depend mostly on how much terrain and map data the
corridor around the route covers. Every course carries the credits of its data: © OpenFreeMap
© OpenMapTiles, data © OpenStreetMap contributors (ODbL); terrain by Mapterhorn (CC BY 4.0) and
AWS Terrain Tiles. Keep them when you share courses.

Courses saved by a newer Torqa may not open in an older one; update Torqa in that case.
