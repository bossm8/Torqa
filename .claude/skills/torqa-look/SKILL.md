# Torqa's look

Torqa's 3D world and riders are **stylized, faceted low-poly** with a **soft pastel palette**:
a toy-like diorama, not a photograph. The decision (user, 2026-10-05): replace realism
completely (no realistic option kept), **faceted everywhere** (world *and* riders), riders made
both from scratch in Blender and from CC0 stylized bases (male and female). Settled with previews
the same day: riders of natural proportions (not toy-like), the ground's facets as fine as the
terrain grid (no extra-large facets), weather and time of day kept pastel. The ADR is
`docs/adr/0011-stylized-look.md`; it wins over this file if they disagree.

## The references

Two pictures the user chose (not in the repo; copyrighted):

1. **World** — a lighthouse island diorama: chunky faceted shapes (conifers as stacked faceted
   cones, a rock as a few big facets), flat colour per facet, no textures, mint sky, warm sand,
   coral roof, cream tower, sage and olive greens, teal shadows in the water. Soft warm key light
   from the upper left, soft long shadows, generous ambient occlusion in creases, everything
   bright and low in contrast.
2. **Rider** — a stylized character: long legs, saturated pastel clothes (pink, yellow, blue),
   plum darks, soft rim light. Torqa keeps the colours and natural proportions (no big toy
   heads) and makes the forms **faceted** like the world.

## Rules

- **Facets, not smoothness.** One normal per face. No smooth shading, no normal maps, no
  subdivision look. Fewer, bigger facets read better than many small ones.
- **Colour, not texture.** No photo textures, no grime, weathering, noise or fine patterns
  (roof tile rows, wood grain, glazing bars, shutter slats). Variation comes from picking
  palette colours per object or instance and from light, at most a very soft large-scale tint
  gradient (e.g. darker at the foot of a wall). The one drawn shape allowed: clean window
  rectangles on building shells (frame and glass), where modelling them would cost too much.
- **Simple, chunky silhouettes.** Exaggerate what identifies a thing (a chalet's big roof and
  balcony, a church tower, a conifer's spikiness); leave out what does not show at riding
  distance (gutters, glazing bars, flower pots smaller than a hand).
- **Bright and soft.** High values, low contrast, no pure black or white; shadows tinted (teal
  or plum), never grey. Warm sun, cool sky fill.
- **No outlines, no cel bands.** Lighting stays smooth across a facet; facets do the stylizing.
- **Not metallic, not glossy.** Roughness high everywhere; water and windows may get a soft
  sheen, nothing mirror-like.

## Palette (sRGB, from the references)

The source of truth is `app/assets/palette.json`; the tables below summarise it.

World:

| Role | Colours |
|---|---|
| Sky, haze | mint `#b5dbce`, horizon `#d6ece4`*, cream clouds `#fbf7ee`* |
| Water | teal `#628388` deep, mint `#9fcfc4`* shallow, foam `#f2ebd9` |
| Ground | meadow sage `#b2c178`, farmland `#bfc67f`*, orchard `#a5b56a`*, forest floor `#7b7f44`, town `#c2c49a`*, rock `#c3bbb4`, snow `#f2ebd9` |
| Road | blue-grey `#8e959b`*, markings `#f2ebd9`, gravel `#d6c5a2`* |
| Plants | conifer olive `#87895e`, broadleaf `#a5b56a`*, trunk `#7a5755` |
| Walls | cream `#f2ebd9`, sand `#efcaa8`, peach `#e8a788`, dusty rose `#bf9282` |
| Roofs, wood | coral `#e2705e`, terracotta `#a57369`, brick `#6b3231`, timber `#7a5755` |
| Light | sun `#fff1dc`*, evening sun `#ffc49a`*, evening sky lilac `#b9b2d8`* to peach `#f4c9b0`*, overcast `#a9b3c1`* to `#d0d5dc`* |

Riders:

| Role | Colours |
|---|---|
| Kit | pink `#efb5cc`, magenta `#ce5aa5`, yellow `#f4c16e`, blue `#5b97c8`, deep blue `#3959a0`, navy `#2e3e7a` |
| Darks | plum `#614367`, aubergine `#4b2e44` |
| Skin | `#bd8877`, `#a4665a`, `#834a40` and lighter tones |

The riders' kits are palette sections of their own (`rider_female`, `rider_male`, by material
name: jersey, sleeve, shorts, …, frame), the rest of the bike is `bike`.

The palette lives in one file, `app/assets/palette.json`: `core/torqa-world/src/palette.rs`
reads it for vertex colours (`palette::srgb("ground.meadow", alpha)`), `app/scenes/palette.gd`
for shader uniforms (`Palette.color("sky.top")`). Add a colour there and use it by name; never
scatter hex values in code. Evening, rain, road and other colours marked * above are Torqa's own
additions. To take a palette from a new reference image, cluster its colours with
`scripts/palette.py` beside this file (k-means in the art container's Blender Python; its
header shows how to run it) and add the ones that fit by name.

## How to get it

- **Faceted shading in Godot:** for meshes built in Rust, give every triangle its own vertices
  and its face normal; or in a spatial shader derive the normal per pixel:
  `NORMAL = normalize(cross(dFdy(VERTEX), dFdx(VERTEX)));` (view space; check the sign against a
  lit test face). Imported models: export flat (split normals per face), see `torqa-art-pipeline`.
- **Colour:** vertex colours or a per-instance colour (MultiMesh `INSTANCE_COLOR` /
  `INSTANCE_CUSTOM`) picked from the palette, sRGB → linear in the shader.
- **Light:** one warm `DirectionalLight3D` (`light.sun`), soft shadows, sky light mixed with a
  warm white (`light.ambient`); **linear tone mapping** with the energies balanced so a sunlit
  facet shows about its palette colour (`RideWorld.TIMES`: sun ≈ 0.8, sky ≈ 0.55, more sky light
  for a low sun) — Filmic or AgX bleach the pastels. Sky as a smooth vertical gradient (mint to
  pale horizon); fog/haze tinted with the horizon colour; SSAO on from Medium up (creases make
  the diorama look); glow subtle. Global illumination matters little for this look.
- **Budgets (triangles):** tree 40–300, bush 20–80, rock 20–100, house 300–1200, church
  800–2000, rider about 3–6k, bike about 1–2k. Fewer is better if the silhouette survives.

## Reviewing a render

Check, in order: silhouettes readable from the road; colours from the palette and harmonious
side by side; facets visible but not noisy; no texture, grime or fine pattern left; light warm,
shadows tinted, AO in creases; distant terrain fading into mint haze. Compare against the two
references described above. Rendering: see the `torqa-render-review` skill.
