//! Bridges and tunnels of the road ridden and the railways. Short, low bridges are stone arch
//! bridges (#75): arched openings between piers, the walls over the arches and the vaults under
//! them; longer and higher ones, and those over a road, a street or a track, are viaducts, their
//! deck on piers as wide as itself. Piers keep off the ways below (#98). Tunnels are an arched
//! tube, starting where the ground rises over it and keeps it covered: a stone ring round the
//! opening at the end of the cutting leading to it (#135). Parallel tracks share one bridge or
//! tunnel, as wide as they need (#99).
